Print 'Main Frame' on its back with support inside the mounting holes. The rest of it is designed to print without support

Print 'Hard Drive Holder' out of TPU with no support and countersinks facing up. The angle can print successfully as an overhang.

DXF for front plate is only going to work with with the iStarUSA D-214-MATX case. Feel free to modify it to have the right screw mounting holes for your case. You do need to bend it. Bend lines are marked and relief lines are also marked for 22 ga steel HOWEVER there isn't enough flange distance in this design. I had them etch the bend line and ignore the relief lines and I just used a jig to bend it. You could get away with a vice too.
